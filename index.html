            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Full Stack web developer skilled in HTML5, CSS3, Git, GitHub, and more! I love the challenge
                of learning new technologies and the satisfaction of solving difficult problems with creative solutions.
            <p>
            <p>I have a background in Benefit Administration and Human Resources with passion for technology and
                improving systems. Picking out one's medical benefits can be very intimating task. I pride myself in the
                knowledge I gained working with benefits. Although the world of benefits is constantly changing with all
                the revisions to the healthcare reform, it doesn't seem as daunting. I welcome the challenge to
                understand new requirements and techniques and get excited about sharing the things I learned with
                others so they can make wise choices when selecting their medical benefits.
            </p>
            <p>I apply this mantra now to my work as a developer. I research the things I don't know, problem solve any
                issues I come across, and figure out ways to share this information with my team.

            <p>I have worked in the Benefits and Human Resource field for several years, but fixing computer issues
                and figuring out how the problem start is always brought me joy. I love problem solving and discovering
                the most efficient solution. This career change has been an exciting one and Iâ€™m happy I made the
                switch.
